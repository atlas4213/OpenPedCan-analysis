##Windows computers dont come with Docker installed so first we must install it using the Docker Desktop for windows. 

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

##Them you can choose whether or not to use the installer or to install it from the command line. Double clicking on the download will initiate the installer

##Command Line install (Must be in the correct location of the download)

"Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install

##Once Docker is installed and laptop has restarted you will probably need to download the WSL 2 backend or you docker daemon will not run (which will 
##cause docker to not load up and be operational)

##How to download and install the linux kernel for the WSL 2 update is listed below (you shouldn't have to do step 6)

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package

##Restart your system and docker should begin running. You can open docker desktop to verify

### Pull and Start Docker Running
​
```bash
# pull latest OT Docker image to make sure you're up to date before you start
[]$ docker pull pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/d3b-bixu/open-pedcan:latest
​
# start docker; will most likely require expanding memory
# for 14 gigabytes of memory -m 14g
# FYI gsea is the example name Jo Lynne gave, but can be anything
#[]$ docker run --name gsea -d -e PASSWORD=GPNFTU -p 8787:8787 -v $PWD:/home/rstudio/OpenPedCan-analysis pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/d3b-bixu/open-pedcan:latest
 []$ docker run --name gsea --rm -ti -v C:\Users\HILLDD\OpenPedCan-analysis -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio
​
# launch bash shell in docker so you can test run module
docker exec -ti gsea bash
```
​
### Developing/Testing Code in Docker
​
Docker has no connection to your outside system, so you need to clone the repo into it
​
```bash
# Docker has NOTHING installed in it, so need to install nano so you can edit if needed; should also be able to edit from RStudio that's launchable from within Docker

[]$ sudo apt-get update

[]$ sudo apt install curl

[]$ sudo apt-get install nano
​
# Clone the OT repo and download data
[]$ git clone https://github.com/kelseykeith/OpenPedCan-analysis.git
[]$ cd OpenPedCan-analysis
# If anything fails md5checksum, remove the problem file and run the command again
[]$ bash download-data.sh
​
# switch to your branch you're working on and then you can test run the code
[]$ git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```

### In Amazon EC2 Instance
​
```bash
### set up in instance
# after setting up ec2 instance according to the instructions in aws_ec2_instructions.md, log into the instance using the IP address generated
[]$ ssh ubuntu@IPADDRESS
# docker is already installed on D3B's EC2 instances so no need to install
# set up tmux so you're good if you get disconnected
[]$ tmux new -s NAME
[]$ cd data-dir
​
### start docker
[]$ docker pull pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/d3b-bixu/open-pedcan:latest
[]$ docker run --name rerun -d -e PASSWORD=GPNFTU -p 8787:8787 -v $PWD:/home/rstudio/OpenPedCan-analysis pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/d3b-bixu/open-pedcan:latest
[]$ docker exec -ti rerun bash
​
### set up OpenPedCan repo in docker
# a couple of things to make my life easier
[]$ apt-get install nano
[]$ alias ll='ls -lh'
# pull git repo, download data, and change to branch I'm working on
[]$ git clone https://github.com/kelseykeith/OpenPedCan-analysis.git
[]$ cd OpenPedCan-analysis/
[]$ bash download-data.sh
[]$ git checkout DEV-BRANCH-NAME
```
